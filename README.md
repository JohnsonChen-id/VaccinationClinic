# Project Vaccination Clinic Simulation Website

This is a Website project designated to simulate the database for an ordinary Vaccination Clinic, consists of different tables of contents such as Staff, Clients, Vaccines, etc. The details of this part is contained in the .sql file, of which creates different tables in a database. In this project, the selected database was on localhost via phpMyAdmin, then executed on localhost with PHP and HTML. 
<br/>
<br/>This is a simple simulation of what users might do to the database in reality, consisting an login system, input & edit, search and group according to different initiatives. 
<br/>
<br/>This project is done in collaboration with Lotus Wei from "CPSC304 : Introduction to Relational Databases", whom did many graphics as well as providing many constructive feedbacks for the written code by me. However, she does not have a private git account for me to accredit for.
